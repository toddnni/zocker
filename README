Zocker

A tool that can manage one process containers on FreeBSD using jails and ZFS. 
Zocker aims to be a simple, but still functional tool to hack and learn 
the container concept. The todo list below is long, but the tool is already 
fully functional and is used to manage applications in a cluster.

Read more about Zocker from the post http://bit.ly/1enEaSH.
There is a tutorial in the post also.

Changes after the post

1. Zocker will automatically generate a loopback address for a container. Then 
   processes can bind to the loopback address inside containers. However, 
   loopback addresses are accessible from other containers on the same host.

TODO
- save architecture into metadata
- locks and error handling are missing from the critical parts (eg. zfs promote, zfs snapshot),
  this can mess snapshots in some error cases
- zocker rmi can't remove tags, all tags are removed when image is deleted
- ctrl-c in rm deletes imageid but not ZFS fs
- ctrl-c in commit leaves trash snapshots to jail and unfinshed image
