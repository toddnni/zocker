Zocker

A tool that can manage one process containers on FreeBSD using jails and ZFS. 
Zocker aims to be a simple, but still functional tool to hack and learn 
the container concept. The todo list below is long, but the tool is already 
fully functional and is used to manage applications in a cluster.

TODO

- save architecture into metadata
- there is not that much error handling and manual cleanups can be necessary in same cases
- locks are missing from the critical parts
- ctrl-c in rm deletes imageid but not ZFS fs
- zocker rmi can't remove tags, all tags are removed when image is deleted
